Project Summary: Climate and Environmental Data Analysis using Python

This project is a structured, multi-stage implementation focused on analyzing weather and environmental datasets using Python. The work progresses from Python fundamentals to real-world data analysis, API integration, visualization, and dashboard development.

Day-wise Work Summary
Day 1 – Python Fundamentals for Data Analysis

Implemented Python basics including variables, lists, dictionaries, loops, and functions

Performed temperature analysis (maximum, minimum, average)

Converted temperature values from Celsius to Fahrenheit

Built foundational logic required for later data analysis tasks

Day 2 – CSV Handling and File System Interaction

Read and explored CSV files using Pandas

Understood working directories and relative file paths

Used OS module to debug file location issues

Gained familiarity with real-world dataset ingestion

Day 3 – Weather Data Analysis and Visualization

Analyzed weekly weather datasets

Generated temperature and rainfall trend plots using Matplotlib

Learned labeling, axis formatting, grid usage, and layout handling

Transformed numerical data into visual insights

Day 4 – Weather Report Generation

Computed summary statistics such as highest rainfall day and average temperature

Implemented logic-based solutions without relying heavily on built-in Pandas shortcuts

Created structured analytical reports from raw datasets

Day 5 – Weather API Integration

Fetched real-time weather data using an external API

Stored API responses into CSV format for analysis

Analyzed and visualized hourly temperature and humidity data

Introduced working with live data sources

Day 6 – Interactive Weather Dashboard

Developed an interactive dashboard using Streamlit

Visualized temperature and humidity trends dynamically

Implemented city-based data selection with dynamic latitude and longitude handling

Learned local deployment of dashboards using Streamlit

Day 7 – NDVI and Rainfall Analysis
