This project demonstrates practical skills in:

Data cleaning

Data analysis

Visualization

API handling

Dashboard creation

Debugging and problem-solving

 Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas – data handling and analysis

Matplotlib – plotting and visualization

OS module – file and directory handling

APIs – real-time weather data fetching

Streamlit – interactive dashboard

VS Code & Jupyter Notebook

Git & GitHub

 Project Structure & Daily Breakdown
🔹 Day 1: Python Basics & Data Handling

Files: day1.py, weather_day1.py

Learned Python basics: variables, lists, dictionaries, loops, and functions

Calculated:

Maximum, minimum, and average temperature

Converted temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit

Understood list operations and dictionary access

 Goal: Build strong Python fundamentals for data analysis.

🔹 Day 2: CSV Data Reading & File Handling

Files: day2.py, weather_day2.py, weather_week_hyd.csv

Read CSV files using Pandas

Understood working directory and file paths

Explored data using .head(), .columns()

Debugged FileNotFoundError using os.getcwd() and os.listdir()

 Goal: Learn how real-world datasets are loaded and explored.

🔹 Day 3: Weather Data Analysis & Visualization

Files: day3.py, weather_day3.py

Analyzed weekly weather data

Plotted:

Temperature trends

Rainfall trends

Learned matplotlib basics:

Labels, titles, grids, rotation

 Goal: Convert raw data into meaningful visual insights.

🔹 Day 4: Weather Report Generation

File: day4_weather_report.py

Generated a summarized weather report

Calculated statistics like:

Highest rainfall day

Average temperature

Used logic instead of built-in Pandas shortcuts where possible

 Goal: Strengthen logical thinking and reporting skills.

🔹 Day 5: Weather API Integration

File: day5_weather_api.py
Data: hyderabad_hourly_weather_api.csv

Fetched real-time weather data using an API

Stored API response into CSV

Analyzed hourly temperature and humidity

Generated plots from live data

 Goal: Work with real-time data sources.

🔹 Day 6: Interactive Weather Dashboard

Files:

day6_weather_dashboard.py

day6_weather_dynamic_city.py

Built an interactive dashboard using Streamlit

Visualized:

Temperature trends

Humidity trends

Implemented:

City selection

Dynamic latitude & longitude handling

Learned how dashboards run locally using streamlit run

 Goal: Present data interactively like real industry tools.

🔹 Day 7: NDVI & Rainfall Analysis

Files:

day7_ndvi_analysis.py

ndvi_rainfall.csv

Analyzed NDVI (vegetation index) alongside rainfall

Converted date columns to datetime format

Plotted:

NDVI trend over time

Rainfall trend over time

Learned debugging of CSV parsing issues

 Goal: Study environmental response to climate factors.

 Key Skills Demonstrated

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Time-series analysis

Data visualization

API integration

Dashboard development

Debugging and error handling

GitHub project management
